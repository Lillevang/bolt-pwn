**XSS and Reverse Shell vulnerabilities in AI-generated webapps**

Earlier this week I tested [bolt.new](https://bolt.new), an AI tool for generating fullstack web apps in the browser.  
It's fast, flashyâ€¦ and dangerously naive when it comes to security.

This repo contains two projects I asked it to generate â€” both with serious vulnerabilities.

## ðŸ’£ Whatâ€™s Inside

### `/node/` â€” Stored XSS

A Node.js + EJS file upload utility generated by Bolt.  
**Vulnerability**: Allowed uploading `.html` files, served them directly â€” no sanitization.

+ ðŸ§ª Run the server:
+ ```bash
+ cd node && npm install && npm run dev
+ ```

ðŸ§ª Payload: [xss.html](node/payload/xss.html) â€” upload this file  
ðŸ”— Visit `/uploads/<filename>` in your browser to trigger the script and verify that the JavaScript executes.

### `/php/` â€” Reverse Shell (RCE)

A PHP file upload handler that:
- Accepts all file types
- Uses original filenames
- Serves uploads from a public directory

+ ðŸ§ª Run the server:
+ ```bash
+ cd php && php -S localhost:8080
+ ```

ðŸ§ª Payload: [shell.php](php/payload/shell.php) â€” insert your private IP or attacker IP.  
ðŸ’¥ Visit `/uploads/shell.php` and ensure you have a listener running:  
```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
