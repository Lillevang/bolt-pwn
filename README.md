**XSS and Reverse Shell vulnerabilities in AI-generated webapps**

Earlier this week I tested [bolt.new](https://bolt.new), an AI tool for generating fullstack web apps in the browser.  
It's fast, flashy… and dangerously naive when it comes to security.

This repo contains two projects I asked it to generate — both with serious vulnerabilities.

---

## 💣 What’s Inside

### `/node/` — Stored XSS

A Node.js + EJS file upload utility generated by Bolt.  
**Vulnerability**: Allowed uploading `.html` files, served them directly — no sanitization.

🧪 Run the server:

```bash
cd node && npm install && npm run dev
```

🧪 Payload: [xss.html](node/payload/xss.html) — upload this file  
🔗 Visit `/uploads/<filename>` in your browser to trigger the script and verify that the JavaScript executes.

---

### `/php/` — Reverse Shell (RCE)

A PHP file upload handler that:
- Accepts all file types
- Uses original filenames
- Serves uploads from a public directory

🧪 Run the server:

```bash
cd php && php -S localhost:8080
```

🧪 Payload: [shell.php](php/payload/shell.php) — insert your private IP or attacker IP.  
💥 Visit `/uploads/shell.php` and ensure you have a listener running:

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repo is for educational and awareness purposes only.
Please don’t deploy this as-is, and don’t use these techniques unethically.

## 🧠 Takeaway

AI tools can build working software in seconds — but they don’t think like attackers.
You still need to review the code, validate inputs, and secure your apps.
